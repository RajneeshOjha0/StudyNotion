Category is only created by "Admin" , if Admin is login then he can create category;

Instructor :- if Instructor is login then he can create "Course" , "Section" , "SubSection" ,

To set type as an ObjectId (so you may reference something to this) in models, you may do like :- type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId
like we do this type in studentsEnrolled So we store many studentsEnrolled_id in this.;
